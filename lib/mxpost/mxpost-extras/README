The directory "wsj-02-21.mxpost" is an MXPOST "project directory", which
contains the results of training MXPOST on Sections 02-21 of the Penn Treebank.

The two scripts ("trainmxpost" and "mxpost") are replacements for scripts of
the same name in the MXPOST distribution.  You can move the old ones out of the
way in your MXPOST install directory, or simply clobber the old ones with the
new ones provided here.

An MXPOST project directory is the sole required argument to the mxpost script
(which runs the tagger), where usage is accomplished with Unix file
redirection:
	mxpost <projectdir> < <inputfile> > <outputfile>
Example usage:
	mxpost wsj-02-21.mxpost < myinputfile > myoutputfile

The format of MXPOST input and output files is contained in the MXPOST.html
file that accompanies the MXPOST distribution.

You can convert freely between the MXPOST tagging format and the tagged input
format used by the parsing engine with the scripts
       adwait2bikel.pl
       bikel2adwait.pl
that are provided as part of the parsing engine install (in the "bin"
directory).  These scripts are used by the "tag-and-train" script that also
comes with the parsing engine software.

MXPOST is available for download from the following URL:
